disagreements in a constructive and respectful manner, without allowing emotions to take over. This
can lead to more productive and positive outcomes in the workplace.

This involves understanding one's own emotions, strengths, and weaknesses, and recognizing how these
factors impact one's interactions with others.

and respond to the emotions of others. This involves actively listening to others, considering their

on one's own behaviors and interactions, and seeking out opportunities for personal and professional
growth.
