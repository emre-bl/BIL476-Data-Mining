expenses, save for emergencies, and build a solid financial foundation for your future. This
includes setting financial goals, creating a budget, and developing a savings plan.

Finally, financial literacy can help you to live a happier and more fulfilling life. When you are in
control of your finances, you are better equipped to make choices that align with your values and
goals. This can include decisions such as starting a business, pursuing a career change, or
traveling the world.

So, how can you improve your financial literacy? There are many resources available, including
financial education classes, books, online courses, and workshops. You can also seek the advice of a
