manageable steps can help individuals feel less overwhelmed and more motivated to complete tasks.

2. Prioritizing Tasks: Prioritizing tasks based on importance and urgency can help individuals focus
on the most critical tasks and reduce the risk of procrastination.

3. Addressing Fear of Failure: Addressing fear of failure can involve reframing the mindset around
failure and embracing it as an opportunity for growth and learning.

4. Practicing Self-Compassion: Practicing self-compassion and avoiding negative self-talk can help
individuals overcome feelings of overwhelm and increase motivation to complete tasks.
